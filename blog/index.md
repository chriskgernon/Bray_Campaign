Diana hosted a pizza party to kick off the new year. This was the first exposure Will and I had to her supporters.

We found out our goal is to get Diana on the ballot for the Democratic Senate Primary for Colorado. This entails collecting 1,500 signitures from each of Colorado's 7 districts. However, in order for a signiture to count, it must be from somone who has been a registered Democrat for at least 30 days, and they cannot have signed another candidates petition who has already turned in their signatures.

Will and I started work at 10.

## January 8, 2020

We began the day by going to what we thought was a climate march at the capital building at 10 am. Unfortunately, we got the date wrong and the climate march was the following day. Instead, we showed up to the freedom vs. force rally. The groups in attendence were: pro-choice, anti-vaxers, and second amendment right protectors. However, this mistake didn't stop us from seizing the day. We used this opportunity to get to know some anti-vaxers and to gather some advertising material.

Then, I mapped where all of the registered democrats were clustered by precinct in congressional districts 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Visit [Diana's volunteer website](https://dianaforcolorado.github.io/volunteer.github.io/) to see my final products. Our plan is to use those maps to target the areas where high density democrats are registered.
