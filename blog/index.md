Diana hosted a pizza party to kick off the new year. This was the first exposure Will and I had to her supporters.

We found out our goal is to get Diana on the ballot for the Democratic Senate Primary for Colorado. This entails collecting 1,500 signitures from each of Colorado's 7 districts. However, in order for a signiture to count, it must be from somone who has been a registered Democrat for at least 30 days, and they cannot have signed another candidates petition who has already turned in their signatures.

Around 5, we drove to staff Diana at a Democratic weekly meeting in the city of Aurora. There, Diana was one of two Senate candidates who spoke.

We began the day by going to what we thought was a climate march at the capital building at 10 am. Unfortunately, we got the date wrong and the climate march was the following day. Instead, we showed up to the freedom vs. force rally. The groups in attendence were: pro-choice, anti-vaxers, and second amendment right protectors. However, this mistake didn't stop us from seizing the day. We used this opportunity to get to know some anti-vaxers and to gather some advertising material.

Then, I mapped where all of the registered democrats were clustered by precinct in congressional districts 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Visit [Diana's volunteer website](https://dianaforcolorado.github.io/volunteer.github.io/) to see my final products. Our plan is to use those maps to target the areas where high density democrats are registered.

We began our day by removing the bed that was in campaign HQ in order to create more spaces to work.

Next, we drove with Diana to a climate march. At the march, people spoke about resisting oil companies and fracking. Speakers called on the Colorado legislature and governor to pass legislation regulating fracking and oil drilling.  30 people got arrested at the rally.

Here is a picture of Will and our fellow intern Maxine at the march!

After the march, we took Diana's petition ballots to the Secretary of State's office to ensure we had the proper format for the petition ballots we will use to collect the 1,500 signatures from each Congressional District Diana needs to get on the ballot.

Next, we organized the campaign's google drive and created a system that all volunteer and event outreach will use to bookkeep what events they've found where Diana could petition and what groups can the team contact to ask for volunteers.
